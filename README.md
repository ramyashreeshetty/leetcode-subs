# LeetCode Submissions 🐍

This repository contains my personal solutions to various **LeetCode** problems. Most of the solutions are written in **Python**.

## Automated Upload with `glsync` ⚡

I use **`glsync`** -> [here](https://github.com/ahmed-e-abdulaziz/glsync), and it automatically syncs my LeetCode submissions with this GitHub repository. Once I submit a solution on LeetCode, it is pushed directly to the repo without manual intervention.

## How It's Organized 📁

Each LeetCode problem is placed in its own folder. The folder name corresponds to the problem title on LeetCode, and each folder contains:

- A Python script (`.py`) with the solution.
- (Optional) A `README.md` file describing the problem and the approach.

## How to Run 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-submissions.git
   cd leetcode-submissions

This is a personal repository, but feel free to suggest improvements.

Happy Coding! 🚀
